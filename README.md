# Australian Vehicle Price Database

## üöó Project Overview

This project contains a **Vehicle Price Database** designed to store and manage information about vehicle brands, models, locations, engine specifications, and inventory in Australia. The database structure ensures relational integrity using foreign key constraints, which helps in maintaining data consistency and reducing redundancy.

## üåê Data Source

__The database and all its data were downloaded from **[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/australian-vehicle-prices/data)** for practice. On Kaggle, the data was originally provided in a single table format, which I then split into normalized tables to improve data integrity and reduce redundancy.__

- **Data Transformation**: I randomly generated `brand_id`, `model_id`, `location_id`, and `engine_id` for each record to normalize the data into separate tables. The `vehicle_id` was in serial number form, and I used **Microsoft Excel** to generate all the individual IDs to ensure that data was properly normalized.
- **Server**: I used **PostgreSQL** as the server and connected it through **VSCode** for convenience and efficient database management.

## üèóÔ∏è Database Schema

### 1. **brands** 
Stores information about vehicle brands.

- `brand_id` (Primary Key)
- `brand_name`

### 2. **models** 
Stores details of vehicle models associated with a brand.

- `model_id` (Primary Key)
- `brand_id` (Foreign Key referencing `brands`)
- `model_name`

### 3. **locations** 
Stores location details where vehicles are available.

- `location_id` (Primary Key)
- `location_name`

### 4. **engine_specs** 
Contains engine specifications for the vehicles.

- `engine_id` (Primary Key)
- `cylinders`
- `engine_size`
- `fuel_type`
- `fuel_consumption`
- `transmission_type`

### 5. **vehicle_inventory** 
Tracks inventory data of vehicles, including price and specifications.

- `vehicle_id` (Primary Key)
- `model_id` (Foreign Key referencing `models`)
- `location_id` (Foreign Key referencing `locations`)
- `engine_id` (Foreign Key referencing `engine_specs`)
- `title`
- `year`
- `price`

## üìã Import Data

To load data into the PostgreSQL database, follow the sequence below. Ensure you **import data in the correct order** to respect foreign key relationships.

### üìÅ SQL Import File

I have also uploaded a SQL file for easy import. You can find it in the Main directory of this repository.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Data Import Order

1. **brands.csv**: Contains brand data (no dependencies).
2. **models.csv**: Contains model data (depends on `brands.brand_id`).
3. **locations.csv**: Contains location data (no dependencies).
4. **engine_specs.csv**: Contains engine specification data (no dependencies).
5. **vehicle_inventory.csv**: Contains vehicle inventory data (depends on `models.model_id`, `locations.location_id`, and `engine_specs.engine_id`).

### üîß How to Import

1. Open `psql` in your terminal and connect to the database:
```bash
psql -d Australian_Vehicle_Price_DB
```

2. You can either:
   - Use the provided SQL file: `load_csv_file.sql`
   - Or use the following commands to import each CSV file individually:

```sql
-- Import Brands
\copy brands FROM '/path/to/brands.csv' WITH (FORMAT csv, HEADER true, DELIMITER ',', ENCODING 'UTF8');

-- Import Models
\copy models FROM '/path/to/models.csv' WITH (FORMAT csv, HEADER true, DELIMITER ',', ENCODING 'UTF8');

-- Import Locations
\copy locations FROM '/path/to/locations.csv' WITH (FORMAT csv, HEADER true, DELIMITER ',', ENCODING 'UTF8');

-- Import Engine Specs
\copy engine_specs FROM '/path/to/engine_specs.csv' WITH (FORMAT csv, HEADER true, DELIMITER ',', ENCODING 'UTF8');

-- Import Vehicle Inventory
\copy vehicle_inventory FROM '/path/to/vehicle_inventory.csv' WITH (FORMAT csv, HEADER true, DELIMITER ',', ENCODING 'UTF8');
```

## üßë‚Äçüíª Troubleshooting Tips

- **Missing Foreign Keys**: Ensure that `brand_id` in `models.csv` exists in `brands.csv`. Similarly, `model_id`, `location_id`, and `engine_id` in `vehicle_inventory.csv` must exist in their respective tables.

- **Missing Data**: If you encounter issues like foreign key constraint errors, check for missing or mismatched data between CSVs.

- **Data Validation**: Before importing, open your CSVs and ensure:
  - There are no blank cells in required fields (use "NA" for placeholders).
  - Data is properly encoded in UTF-8 format.

- **Correct Delimiters**: Make sure CSV files use commas (`,`), not semicolons or tabs.

## üìÑ Files Included

- **`brands.csv`**: Contains brand details.
- **`models.csv`**: Contains model details.
- **`locations.csv`**: Contains location details.
- **`engine_specs.csv`**: Contains engine specifications.
- **`vehicle_inventory.csv`**: Contains vehicle inventory details.
- **`import_script.sql`**: SQL script for easy database import.

Feel free to fork this repo, make changes, and submit a pull request for any enhancements or bug fixes!

### üìå Note:

- Always maintain the data import sequence to ensure smooth import and relational integrity.
- This schema is optimized for vehicle price management, so avoid adding or changing the structure without considering dependencies.
